In this analysis, I explored the Iris dataset using basic data visualization techniques.
I examined the relationship between sepal length and petal length using a scatter plot.

The scatter plot shows a clear positive correlation between the two variables, meaning
that as sepal length increases, petal length also tends to increase.
The points are not randomly distributed, which suggests a strong relationship.

This visualization helps in understanding how different features in the dataset
are related to each other.
